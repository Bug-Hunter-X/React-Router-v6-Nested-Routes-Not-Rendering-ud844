This repository demonstrates a common issue with nested routes in React Router v6 and its solution. The original App.js showcases the problem where nested routes fail to render. AppSolution.js provides the corrected implementation.  The issue is often related to incorrect path definitions or missing elements in the route structure. The solution emphasizes proper use of the `useParams` hook and precise path configurations within nested routes.
